# Churn Prediction Using Random Forest

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services, enabling proactive retention strategies and reduced revenue loss.

The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation. Random Forest is chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships, reduce overfitting, and provide feature importance insights.

## Project Overview

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing features for model training. Exploratory analysis is performed to understand customer behavior and identify key factors influencing churn. The Random Forest classifier is then trained and evaluated using standard classification metrics.
